I use this script for everything at work at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

I support StoreOnce and StoreEver technologies at HPE.

See if you like some parts of this script, if you have any questions,
feel free to ask me as much as you like, i will always try to answer
any and all of your requests.

This "code" (It's really just scripting) will require you to install
Autohotkey in Windows.

Here is the link for that:

Feel free to use this, as much as you like, there is nothing groundbreaking
in here.

If you do use it and have problems with it, then please send me a message via Github.

Autohotkey is quite powerful and can easily mess up a lot of things, so be careful when
using any scripts, that also goes for mine, they are not infalible.

Hope you like it.
